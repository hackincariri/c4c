In addition, we trust in the integrity of the community and participants who submit challenges. Our goal is to foster an environment of fairness and honesty, where community contribution is genuinely valued. Call For Challenges (C4C) was designed to encourage greater community participation, promoting the spirit of collaboration and rejecting any forms of inequality or dishonor in our community.

**Q: How will the challenge score be defined?**

A: The score of approved challenges will be determined by the event team. Each challenge will be evaluated based on its complexity, originality, and contribution to CTF diversity. The event team will assign an appropriate score to each approved challenge, taking into account various factors.

**Q: What is the flag format?**

A: Our flags have the following format HIK + SOME TEXT + MD5 HASH OF THE FLAG. E.g.: **HIK_EASY_REVERSE_CHALLENGE_c22062e7a20164b9b89b38527b4e7f82**
