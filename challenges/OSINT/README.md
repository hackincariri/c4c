# OSINT Challenge Submission

## What pattern should I follow?

- OSINT challenges cannot contain personal data of other people.
- We discourage using your personal data to create an OSINT challenge.
- Fake websites and relevant information can be created for OSINT challenges.

## Example

In the example directory we have the README.md file that contains all the challenge information.
