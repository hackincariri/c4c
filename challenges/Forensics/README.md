# Forensics Challenge Submission

## What pattern should I follow?

NOTE: Due to the nature of forensics challenges, which present a wide variety of problems, we will only address some types here.

- We do not accept any type of pre-compiled files.
- All files relevant to the challenges, such as pcap examples, images, forensic copies, emails, etc., should not exceed 50 MB.

## Example

In the example directory, we have a forensics challenge that contains an email file to be analyzed.
